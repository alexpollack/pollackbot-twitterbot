I decided to make a twitter bot as I was first beginning to learn about machine learning, specifically natural language processing. This is the code and set up information for a Twitter bot I made linked to my account. Every hour, there is a certain scripted probability that the bot will compose and send a tweet. The corpus used is the library of my personal twitter tweets and replies.
